# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible receiving such patches depends on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| CVSS v3.0 | Supported Versions                        |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 9.0-10.0  | Releases within the last three months    |
| 4.0-8.9   | Most recent release                       |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities to **[iepathos@gmail.com](mailto:iepathos@gmail.com)**. You will receive a response from us within 48 hours. If the issue is confirmed, we will release a patch as soon as possible depending on complexity but historically within a few days.

## Security Measures

### Development Security
- All dependencies are regularly audited using `cargo audit`
- Automated security scanning runs weekly and on every pull request
- License compliance is enforced through `cargo deny`
- Supply chain security is monitored through dependency verification

### Build Security
- All releases are built in isolated GitHub Actions environments
- Release binaries include SHA256 checksums for integrity verification
- Cross-compilation targets are verified for consistency
- Build artifacts are created reproducibly where possible

### Code Security
- Rust's memory safety features prevent common security vulnerabilities
- All code goes through review before being merged
- Automated linting and formatting enforce consistent code quality
- Security-focused clippy lints are enabled and enforced

### Dependency Security
- Dependencies are automatically updated by Dependabot
- Major version updates require manual review
- Only well-maintained crates from trusted sources are used
- Transitive dependencies are regularly audited

## Security Features

### Stillwater Security
- Templates are validated before processing
- File system operations are sandboxed to project directories
